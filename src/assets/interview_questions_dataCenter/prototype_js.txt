JavaScript is a prototype based language, so, whenever we create a function using JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a prototype property inside a function, Prototype property is basically an object (also known as Prototype object), where we can attach methods and properties in a prototype object, which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.
<br/>
Consider the example below:-
<br/>
There are different ways to create an object, one of the way is to create an object using function constructor.
<br/>

// function constructor
<br/>
function Person(name, job, yearOfBirth){   
<br/>
    this.name= name;
<br/>
    this.job= job;
<br/>
    this.yearOfBirth= yearOfBirth;
<br/>
}
<br/>
// this will show Person's prototype property.
<br/>
console.log(Person.prototype);
